## Conflict
The same file - testing-homework.md - was modified in two branches.
Merging the first branch to main was ok, as there was no anyy conflict yet.
Merging the second branch involved to conflict, as there already was change in the same place in the main branch.
The conflict was manually resolved in nano: both change were left in the file, one after another, HEAD and conflict commit pointer were removed.

## Members work
Each member were working on branches. Andrei and Sergei made a conflict.
